# React Best Practices

## [15 React Best Practices You Need to Follow in 2021](https://www.codeinwp.com/blog/react-best-practices/)

### 1. Keep components small and function-specific
- Make our component small
- Small component can be reused across multiple projects

### 2. Reusability is important, so keep creation of new components to the minimum required
- Reusing component to achieve consistency
- If any component becomes huge, it's better to break it up into smaller components.

### 3. Consolidate duplicate code - DRY your code
- Keep it brief and concise as possible

### 4. Put CSS in JavaScript
- I don't particularly agree with this. But let's make some modification to this point. This point actually tells us to write our own styling in a different file (specific for which component) and use this style in our component.

### 5. Comment only where necessary
- Like Uncle Bob said, if our code is self-explained, then comments are not necessary.
- If we want to emphasize or make some process is easier to read. Then, writing comments would be a good idea.

### 6. Name the component after the function
- Component's name conveys what the component does
  
### 7. Use capitals for component names

### 8. Mind the other naming conventions

### 9. Separate stateful aspects from rendering
- Keep the operation logic separate from the rendering.
  
### 10. Code should execute as expected and be testable

### 11. All files related to any one component should be in a single folder
- Keep all files relating to any one component in a single folder, including styling files.
- Tests also reside on the same folder

### 12. Use tools like Bit (Good to have, but not necessary)

### 13. Use snippet libraries

### 14. Write tests for all code

### 15. Follow linting rules, break up lines that are too long
